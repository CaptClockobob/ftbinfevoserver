The Lich has 3 stages: In the first stage, the Lich and its 2 Twilight Lich Shadows will shoot slow-moving projectiles at the player. Dodge the fireballs and reflect the Ender Pearl projectiles back at the Lich by hitting them (similar to Ghasts) to remove the Lich\u0027s shields. While the Lich has its shields, it takes no damage. In the second stage, the Lich will spawn special Zombies to attack the player. Also, the Twiligth Lich Shadows will leave, and will not return. Kill the Zombies to progress to the next stage. In the third and final stage, the Lich will equip a Gold Sword and attack. Each hit will do 4.5 hearts of damage unarmored. Killing the Lich in its third form will drop the Lich Trophy and one of 3 scepters. The Scepter of Twilight will fire the same projectile the Lich does in the first stage, dealing up to 3 hearts of damage, with a chance of bypassing armor. The Scepter of Life Draining damages mobs as you hold right click, while healing you for a fraction of the damage dealt. Finally, the Zombie Scepter will summon Zombie minions, like the second stage of the Lich fight. They will fight hostile mobs for you, excluding Creepers. Each scepter has durability and their own recipes to recharge. They will not break, just stop working until they are recharged, so you don\u0027t have to worry.

The Dark Tower is a very interesting dungeon in that it has several puzzles to surpass (if you don\u0027t have a means of flight, in which case you can just fly to the top). Enter by right-clicking on a door made of Reappearing Blocks at the bottom. Some of the Towerwood looks a bit singed, that is Infested Towerwood. Breaking Infested Towerwood will spawn a Towerwood Borer, which drops Borer Essence, which is an ingredient in Carminite. Several parts of the Dark Tower use Anti-Builders, which disallow you to place or permanently remove blocks. Blocks placed will be dropped, and blocks destroyed will be replaced with Anti-Built Blocks. Near the top is a puzzle involving Carminite Builders. These turn on with a redstone signal, given by the lever nearby, and will build blocks in the location the player is looking. So, the strategy here is to give it a redstone signal, follow the blocks as they\u0027re being placed, and turn your head to change direction to the next platform. At the top of this puzzle is a couple buffer floors, giving the crafting recipes for Carminite and Carminite related blocks. There is also a nearly finished Carminite Reactor Finish it by extending the pistons so that the redstone blocks on all sides touch the Reactor. The Ur-Ghast cannot be harmed with melee attacks, so you must use a bow or reflect it\u0027s fireballs back at it. The easiest way to kill it is through the 4 Ghast Traps at the top of the Dark Tower. The Ghast Traps are charged by killing Carminite Ghastlings near them. About 3 Carminite Ghastlings will charge the Ghast Trap, allowing them to work with a redstone signal. Wait until the Ur-Ghast is directly above the Ghast Trap, then stand on the pressure plate to activate it. It will spend its charge to harm the Ur-Ghast while keeping it in place, allowing the player to shoot it easily. Once the Ur-Ghast is defeated, it will spawn a chest with loot in the center room at the top. Drop and pick up the Ur-Ghast Trophy and the Fiery Tears to get the achievement that allows access to the Snowy Forest biome.",
