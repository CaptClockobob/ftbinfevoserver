However, the wolf cannot wear armor, and has a weakness to silver.

However, the Wolfman form also cannot wear armor, transforming will force item being held to be dropped, and has a weakness to silver. The weakness to silver is very significant: damage weaponry deals double damage and ignores the werewolf\u0027s natural armor. You can increase the level of the werewolf by doing certain quests, which gives the werewolf several abilities. Werewolves can become vampires, as well. However, there are several drawbacks to doing so: the wolf/wolfman forms cannot use vampire powers, feeding as a wolf does not restore hunger (only draining blood can), the hybrid becomes weak to silver, as well as fire and sun, and the maximum blood storage for a hybrid is roughly two thirds that of a pure vampire.",

They will try to attack the first person they see, but they can be calmed by a Demonic Contract that has been signed with blood (aka crafted with a bound Taglock Kit), along with about 25 levels of experience. Once the Imp has been signed into a contract, it will protect its master from attackers. Giving a Demon Heart to the Flame Imp will make it much stronger for 30 minutes. However, it will not be able to use Imp Magic until it calms down.",
