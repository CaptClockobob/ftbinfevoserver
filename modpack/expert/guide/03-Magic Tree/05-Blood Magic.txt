§0Now that we have some basic ingredients we can make our blood altar:

[bloodaltar]

And we need to get blood into that somehow, so now for Expert Mode's Sacrificial Orb:

The good news is, we don't have to go too far into blood magic to start getting our slates. However you will need a few of those Thaumcraft stones now.

And we should get our blood orb as well which will take a mana diamond:

Before moving on from blood magic, it is a good idea to get at least to the tier 2 alter which will require 16 slates to make the blood runes. Now let make a few brewing stands and send them trough the alter for our next journey.

Now at this point we have a decent infrastructure of all magic schools except the runic altar.
