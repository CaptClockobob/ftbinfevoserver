§2§lTinkers Tools
§0 After you have collected your first round of resources you'll want to get into tinkers tools.
Before you can get into the metal tools you will need a bucket for lava.  See "Getting the Bucket" Section of this guide for that information.
You will want to gather some iron, some coal, and perhaps loot a bit for smeltery parts or if you're lucky some creosote oil. 

§2 Note: the Tool Forge recipe has been changed to be much farther down the line in progression, so you will have to use the basic tools for now.
